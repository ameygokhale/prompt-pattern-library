# Prompt Pattern Library

## Overview
This project is a reusable Prompt Pattern Library designed to demonstrate
entry-level prompt engineering skills, such as prompt structuring,
iteration, output evaluation, and prompt chaining.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Prompt template design
- Output evaluation criteria
- Prompt iteration workflows
- Prompt chaining
- Clear documentation

## What Is a Prompt Pattern?
A prompt pattern is a reusable instruction template that produces
predictable, improvable outputs from large language models.

Each pattern includes:
- Goal
- Prompt template
- Expected output
- Improvement notes

## Core Prompt Patterns
- Clarifier Prompt
- Step-by-Step Planner
- Output Critic
- Rewrite & Improve
- Decision Helper
- Learning Path Designer
- Prompt Improver (Meta)
- Reflection Prompt

## Prompt Chaining Example
See `/examples/prompt-chaining.md` for a full workflow example.

## Screenshots
Screenshots in this repo show real prompt usage and iteration examples.
